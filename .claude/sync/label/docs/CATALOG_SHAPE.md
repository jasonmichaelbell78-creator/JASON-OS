# CATALOG_SHAPE.md — Records Piece 3 Writes

**Piece:** 3 — Labeling Mechanism
**Status:** ACTIVE (S1 scaffolding)
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-20 (Session #10)
**Plan:** `.planning/piece-3-labeling-mechanism/PLAN.md` §S1
**Decisions:** `.planning/piece-3-labeling-mechanism/DECISIONS.md`
**Upstream schema:** `.claude/sync/schema/SCHEMA.md` (Piece 2)

---

## §1 Purpose

This document is the contract between Piece 3 (hooks + pre-commit + audit
skill + back-fill orchestrator) and Piece 4 (registry / storage). It
specifies the shape of every record the Piece 3 machinery writes into the
JSONL catalogs — including the Piece 3 augmentations on top of the Piece 2
schema.

Piece 3 does **not** own the record schema — Piece 2 does. Piece 3 adds a
small number of machinery-level fields that track the derivation pipeline
state (async fills, manual overrides, low-confidence flags, hook firing
history, schema version). Those fields are the focus here.

Piece 4 will later decide final catalog paths and file format. Piece 3
assumes JSONL at the paths listed in §5; `catalog-io.js` (Plan §S2) is the
single point of change when Piece 4 moves things.

---

## §2 Primary Key

**`path`** — repo-root-relative path to the file.

Invariants:

- Unique within a given catalog file (one record per file per catalog).
- Stable across sync — the same `path` in JASON-OS and SoNash refers to the
  same logical file when both repos carry it (follows Piece 2's mirror
  contract).
- Forward slashes always. Writers normalize `\` → `/` on ingest.

All Piece 3 reads/writes go through `catalog-io.js` and use `path` as the
lookup key.

---

## §3 Record Fields — Inheritance from Piece 2

Every record Piece 3 writes carries:

1. **All 26 universal file-level columns** from Piece 2 `SCHEMA.md` §3:
   - §3.1 Identity: `name`, `path`, `type`, `purpose`
   - §3.2 Scope / sync-action: `source_scope`, `runtime_scope`,
     `portability`, `status` (but see §4.1 below — Piece 3 extends the
     `status` enum)
   - §3.3 What the file needs: `dependencies`, `external_services`,
     `tool_deps`, `mcp_dependencies`, `required_secrets`
   - §3.4 Provenance: `lineage`, `supersedes`, `superseded_by`
   - §3.5 Sync mechanics: `sanitize_fields`, `state_files`
   - §3.6 Catch-all + coupling: `notes`, `data_contracts`
   - §3.7 Relationships: `component_units`, `composite_id`
   - §3.8 Copy detection: `is_copy_of`, `has_copies_at`, `content_hash`
   - §3.9 Content granularity: `sections`

2. **Per-type extensions** from Piece 2 `SCHEMA.md` §9 (NOT §10 —
   §10 is evolution rules). The per-type extension set applied depends on
   `type`:
   - `skill` → §9.1
   - `agent | team` → §9.2
   - `hook | hook-lib` → §9.3
   - `memory | canonical-memory` → §9.4
   - `script | script-lib` → §9.5
   - `tool | tool-file` → §9.6
   - `research-session` → §9.7
   - `plan | planning-artifact` → §9.8
   - `ci-workflow` → §9.9
   - Composite records → §9.10 (in the composites catalogs, not file
     catalogs)

3. **Optional `migration_metadata`** sub-object per Piece 2 `SCHEMA.md` §6 —
   `null` for native (non-ported) files.

Piece 3's derivation library (Plan §S2 `derive.js`) produces these fields
per the logic in each subsection. The audit skill (Plan §S7) re-runs
derivation on demand to detect drift.

---

## §4 Piece 3 Additions

Six machinery-level fields that every record carries on top of the Piece 2
universals. All writes through `catalog-io.js`.

### §4.1 `status` — enum extension

Piece 2's `status` enum has 8 values: `active`, `complete`, `deferred`,
`stub`, `gated`, `deprecated`, `archived`, `generated` (SCHEMA.md §8.4).

Piece 3 adds **one** new value: **`partial`** — a transient state meaning
"the sync partial record has been written, but the async understanding-field
fill is still pending." Used by the PostToolUse write hook (Plan §S3) for
the ~milliseconds-to-seconds window before the async agent returns.

`stub` is already in the Piece 2 enum — no action needed for that value.

**Schema-bump implication (per Piece 2 D5 + `EVOLUTION.md`):** adding one
enum value is a **minor version bump**, non-breaking. The actual
`schema-v1.json` edit is scheduled to land with **Plan §S2** (where
`validate-catalog.js` first reads the enum via ajv). Until then,
CATALOG_SHAPE.md is the authoritative place the extended value is
documented. After the bump, the schema moves from v1.0 → v1.1 and
`schema_version` on every record (see §4.6) advances accordingly.

**Invariant:** `status: partial` records are **rejected at commit time** by
the pre-commit validator (Plan §S6, D3). They are valid in the live catalog
between derivation and async completion, but must never appear in a commit.

### §4.2 `pending_agent_fill` — boolean

`true` iff an async derivation agent is still running for this record.
Cleared to `false` when the agent returns (success or failure).

Writers:

- Set `true` by the PostToolUse hook (Plan §S3) when it spawns an async job
- Set `false` by the same hook's Step 0 sweep when it sees the job finished
- Also cleared by the audit skill (Plan §S7) if a manual re-derivation
  settles the record

**Invariant:** `status: partial` ⇒ `pending_agent_fill: true`. The pre-commit
validator enforces this via `status: partial` rejection alone.

### §4.3 `manual_override` — array of strings

List of field names the user explicitly set via conversational override (D12a
+ Plan §S9). Example: `["type", "portability"]` means the user told Claude
these two fields have specific values that should not be re-derived.

**Consumer:** the PostToolUse hook MUST skip fields listed here when
re-deriving. The derivation library reads `manual_override` before running
each field's derivation step.

**Revocation:** user can say "let it auto-derive again" — Claude removes the
field name from `manual_override` per Plan §S9 "Edge cases" section.

**Default:** empty array `[]`.

**Audit trail:** every `manual_override` mutation is logged to
`.claude/state/label-override-audit.jsonl` (Plan §S9).

### §4.4 `needs_review` — array of strings

List of field names whose derivation produced low confidence or unresolved
cross-check disagreement (D3, D8 + Plan §S8). Example: `["type", "purpose"]`
means confidence on those two fields fell below threshold (default 0.80) or
the primary/secondary back-fill agents disagreed.

**Invariant:** `needs_review` is **non-empty ⇒ pre-commit validator blocks
the commit** (D3 + Plan §S6). The user must either:

1. Manually resolve via conversational override (sets `manual_override`
   and clears the corresponding entry from `needs_review`)
2. Re-run `/label-audit` on the file and accept the new derivation
3. Skip with `SKIP_CHECKS=labels SKIP_REASON="..."` (intentional, logged)

**Default:** empty array `[]`.

### §4.5 `last_hook_fire` — ISO 8601 timestamp string

Most recent timestamp at which any hook touched this record. Used by
fingerprint-triggered re-check logic (D6 path 2, Plan §S3) and by the audit
skill's `--recent` filter (Plan §S7 invocation pattern).

Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` (UTC, millisecond precision).

### §4.6 `schema_version` — string

Semver-compatible version of the schema this record conforms to. Examples:
`"1.0"`, `"1.1"`.

**Why per-record:** D16 migration strategy (eager atomic schema migration)
uses this field to determine whether a record needs an upgrade pass. When a
new schema version ships, the migration tool reads `schema_version` on each
record, applies the delta, and writes the new value.

**Writer contract:** every writer (hooks, back-fill, audit skill) stamps
`schema_version` to the current schema version at write time. Never back-dated.

---

## §5 Catalog Files (per D14)

Piece 3 writes four JSONL files under `.claude/sync/label/`:

| File | Scope | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shared.jsonl` | Mirrored identically across JASON-OS and SoNash | File records with `source_scope ∈ {universal, user}` (per repo's mirror policy). One record per line. |
| `local.jsonl` | Per-repo, never mirrored | File records with `source_scope ∈ {project, machine, ephemeral}`. One record per line. |
| `composites-shared.jsonl` | Mirrored | Composite records whose every component is in `shared.jsonl`. |
| `composites-local.jsonl` | Per-repo | Composite records with any component in `local.jsonl`. |

**Preview artifacts (Plan §S8):** back-fill orchestration writes to
`.claude/sync/label/preview/shared.jsonl` + `preview/local.jsonl` and flips
atomically to the real paths only after user approval (D9c).

**Atomicity guarantee:** `catalog-io.js` (Plan §S2) writes via temp-file +
rename — crash-safe; partial writes never land on disk.

---

## §6 Piece 4 Interface

> **Piece 4 owns final catalog path + format decisions.** The JSONL layout
> and paths documented in §5 are Piece 3's interim assumption, not a
> commitment binding on Piece 4.

If Piece 4 moves the catalog to TOML, SQLite, a different directory, or
merges shared/local into a single file with a scope column:

- **Single point of change:** `.claude/sync/label/lib/catalog-io.js` (Plan
  §S2). All Piece 3 reads and writes go through this layer.
- **No downstream change required** in hooks, pre-commit validator, audit
  skill, or back-fill orchestrator — they all call
  `readCatalog(path) → records[]` and `writeCatalog(path, records) → void`.
- **Record shape is invariant across storage formats.** The 26 universal
  columns + 6 Piece 3 additions + per-type extensions are the contract;
  how they serialize is Piece 4's call.

**Piece 4 MAY renegotiate:**

- Catalog path and filename (moves from `.claude/sync/label/` to anywhere)
- Storage format (JSONL → TOML, SQLite, Parquet, etc.)
- Shared/local split (could become a single table with a scope discriminator)
- Composite catalog split (could merge into file catalog with a record-type
  discriminator)

**Piece 4 MUST NOT renegotiate without a schema bump:**

- The 26 universal columns (Piece 2 owns)
- The 6 Piece 3 additions documented in §4 (Piece 3 owns; major bump to
  remove any of them)
- The `path`-as-primary-key invariant (§2)
